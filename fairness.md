D =

P(Y=1|A=1) >

  - You __do__ have a threshold; the threshold is expressed through a value that the formula


P(A = )

D(A = 1 | )

||0|1|
|0|0|

## Demographic Parity

P(D = 1 | A = 1) = P(D = 1 | A = 0)
P(D = 1 | A = 0) = P(D = 1, X = 1 | A = 1) + P(D = 1, X = 0 | A = 1)

- I guess that equal sign imposes that the probability of people with different demographic traits getting the same treatment of reward should be the same.

- A mathematical description of fairness (rendition of fairness, mechanism of fairness) exists.
