### Being used right now

1. sex
2. age
3. prior arrests
4. jail time
5. charge degree

---

6. two year recidivism

- These are set against the COMPAS scores.


### Questions


- What does the clustering reveal?

- How does it compare with the COMPAS scores?

- How does it compare with race?

### Not being used

- Juvenile felonies count
- Juvenile misdemeanors count
- Juvenile others count
- Prior charges count
- Days before screening arrest

### Other things we have

- The date when the test is being administered (is this meaningful?).

### Further ideas

- Comparing charge degree of "C" (first arrest) with charge degree of "R" and "V" (second arrest).
- Distance between score for general recidivism and violent recidivism. What crimes are more associated with one or the other?

### Perfecting the current plotting of distance

- Variables being used:

	- sex;
	- age;
	- prior arrests;
	- charge degree;
	- jail time;
	- juvenile felonies;
	- juvenile misdemeanors;
	- juvenile others;
	- type of charge?

- Visualize against:
	- compas score;
	- race;
	- actual recidivism.
