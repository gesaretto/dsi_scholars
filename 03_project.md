- No evidence was found that spending
more time in prison raises the
recidivism rate. The evidence was
mixed regarding whether serving
more time reduces recidivism.

    - Can we investigate the correlation between time spent in prison and occurrence of recidivism?

        - Does this correlation change depending on age? And what about other factors?

    - Can we look into the likelihood of receiving a longer sentence depending on racial factors, or other factors (type of crime, age, sex...)?


#### Ways to categorize crime

1. The one suggested in the Zeng/Ustun/Rudin piece.

    1. arrest;
    2. drug;
    3. general_violence;
    4. domestic_violence;
    5. sexual_violence;
    6. fatal_violence.

2. The one suggested in the first part of the Lagan/Levin investigation.

    1. violent offense (for example, murder, sexual assault, and robbery);
    2. property offense (for example, burglary, auto theft, and fraud);
    3. drug offense (primarily drug trafficking and possession);
    4. public-order offense (roughly 33% driving while intoxicated/driving under the influence, 32% a weapons offense, 8% a traffic offense, 9% a probation violation, and the remainder, such crimes as escape, obstruction of justice, court offense, parole violation, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, bigamy, and habitual offender);
    5. some other offense (for example, an unspecified felony or misdemeanor).
